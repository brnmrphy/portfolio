DISCLAIMER: To be completely honest, my corpus idea is not set in stone just yet. There are a lot of different aspects of Spotify that I would like to research (':

One of these aspects is the time signature within different genres. So for example what time siganture is most/least popular in hip-hop. Another would be political ties with certain artists/albums: which Kendrick Lamar album has the most political terms? Comparing the energy of the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings with the energy flow of the film itself is also something I'm interested in (or some other comparison with The Lord of the Rings soundtrack but I couldn't think of one right now...). Looking at the tempo of songs in the top ten from for example 1980 till now would be interesting. I would also like to compare the 'sadness' of songs. So for example comparing the level of 'sadness' between a Smiths album and a Elliott Smith album. Opera and heavy metal are both genres I experience as being loud, so comparing the 'loudness' of the two genres might make for some interesting results. The influence of the public image on musicians is something I find very interesting, so comparing the listening activity of fans/listerners of let's say R. Kelly before and after his arrest might give interesting results. Some more examples would be before and after the allegations of Micheal Jackson or A$AP Rocky.
